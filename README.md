# FinalProject
This project aims to create a machine learning model which can effectively predict the optimum number of tests required for individual well with a minimum error. The error percentage set for this project is 2%. 

In this project I have used two approach. In approach 1 it utilizes classification algorithms and in approach 2 used regression algorithms.
Major ML models used are:
1) Linear Regression
2) Logistic Regression
3) LSTM
4) Random Forest
5) Decision Tree
6) Gaussian Process Regressor
7) MLP Regressor
